# sadBot
sadBot is a python script that will search donald trumps 200 most recent tweets for any string inputed, and print out all results.
this was a small script I made while learning API useage and python basics.

# Usage:
You will need your own twitter access tokens and keys for this to work. These can be generated fairly easily by generating a new app in the twitter
developer section. Place them in keys.py.
